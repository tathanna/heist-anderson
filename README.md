Preparing astronauts for operations in space has historically been a very difficult task. Sensory immersion in the training environment is difficult to achieve, as there are many major differences between Earth and space environments (e.g. gravity, visual surroundings, physical restrictions, etc.). With the recent revival of interest in human space exploration in the past decade, the need is now greater than ever for cost-efficient, high-immersion astronaut training programs to prepare the next generation of explorers for increasingly complex space operations. Companies are looking for ways to create adaptive and integrated hybrid-reality simulations to prepare their future space explorers for their journey to discover and develop new worlds.

The Hybrid Environmental Immersive Simulation Training (HEIST) project aims to fill this need by using a hybrid reality system to create an immersive training environment simulating the visual, auditory, and tactile aspects of a Lunar environment. If successful, the system developed by the HEIST team will drastically reduce the cost of training astronauts, while simultaneously making astronaut training more immersive, safe, and effective. These improvements may save a program millions of dollars in training costs and will allow for the training of more astronauts as crew sizes continue to grow.
